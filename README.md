# AOC 2022

This is all of my solutions for Advent of Code 2022. All the solutions are in C++. 

### If you are solving in C++ , then what are the script files for?
- This script will compile and execute the cpp file for the day.
    ```bash
      ./run.sh <day>
    ```
- This script will create two files, a text file called ```input<day>.txt``` and ```aoc<day>.txt``` in their respective directories(They are made from a template, files ```template.txt```and ```template.cpp``` repsectively)
    ```bash
      ./setupTemplate.sh <day>
    ```
